The hip joint is one of the largest muscles in our body. Feeling tight in and around the hips can not only be uncomfortable but can also lead to pain in other parts of the body such as the knees or the lower back.

This 3hr workshop starts by looking at the anatomical structure of your hips and its compartments. You will learn about how your hips move, what postures stretch what part of your hips and what influence does your emotional state have on the feeling in your hips.

You will be guided through a gentle Vinyasa Flow sequence (yang) that focuses on stretching and opening the muscles in and around your hips.

This practice prepares the body for the deep releases of  Yin Yoga where we hold hip opening postures for a longer period of time in order to go deeper into the connective tissues around the hips to release both physical and emotional tension stored in this area.

By the end of the workshop you’ll know your hips better and you have gained more awareness and understanding on how to keep your hips happy and healthy.  

This workshop suits absolute beginners as well as advanced practitioners who would like to refine their practice and deepen their knowledge.

Tuition is 15€, or 12€ if you reserve your spot before Feb 4th
