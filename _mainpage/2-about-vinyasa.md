Vinyasa Yoga is a popular form of Hatha Yoga, developed by T. Krishnamacharia.

‘Flow’ refers to the way in which the asanas (body postures) are performed. The postures flow smoothly into each other, almost like a dance. And the breath gives the rhythm to that dance. Focusing on a calm but deep and energizing breath while moving, brings harmony into body and mind. A strong Asana practice strengthens the muscles and, if practiced right, leads to better physical health.
