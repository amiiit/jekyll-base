My mission as a Yoga teacher is to guide and help students to reach the intimate interplay between body and mind, on their path to inner tranquility and better physical health.

My Yoga journey began in 2008 when I took my first Ashtanga Yoga class. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw how all the people in the room were bending their bodies (I was quite inflexible before I started with yoga), breathing loud and focusing so hard on what they were doing. I knew then that practicing yoga must be something very special and so I got a ticket for a whole month. Since then this journey has never ended.

After this month I travelled to India where I could explore different styles of yoga and meditation techniques and I fell in love with Vinyasa Flow Yoga. Deep breathing while moving through challenging poses helps me to center my mind and keeps my body fit and supple.

I like(d) this practice so much that I felt I wanted to share it with other people. So I decided to do a teacher training. Right after this 200hr training (in 2011) my inspiring teacher Luz Orea gave me the great  opportunity to teach in her yoga center in Mexico. I was practically thrown into hot water, which was the best start for my teachings.

Since then I’m sharing my knowledge in different parts of the world. I haven’t stopped being a student of yoga and meditation, studying different styles and traditions, participating in workshops like yoga anatomy, assisting/adjusting, partner yoga, yin/yang or thai yoga massage.

I have worked with and learned from several inspiring teachers who have brought me where I am today, e.g. Jason Crandell, Luz Orea, Victor Thiele, Kathryn Budig and many others. 

Yoga is teaching  me to be my own witness. It's showing me my edges and helps me accepting what is and what I have and to work with that.
