In my classes you’ll be guided through dynamic and creative sequences that emphasise both the physical and the mental aspects behind Yoga.

We flow mindfully through accessible but physically challenging postures with the intention to strengthen and center body and mind.

You get clear and detailed instructions to find the best body alignment in every posture, in order to keep you safe and get most physical benefits out of your asana practice.

# Private Session
The open classes don’t fit your schedule or you prefer to have a more personalized practiced, following your own rhythm?
Then one to one sessions or small private group (max 4 people) classes might be just what you need.

According to your wishes and needs I’ll create an effective yoga practice for you and give you personalized attention. You will decide the location and the time you wish to practice, so your yoga class will fit optimally into your daily schedule.
Private classes are a great way to begin with Yoga, as well as deepen into your practice if you are an advanced practitioner.  Each class allows you to become more aware of your body, enhance your senses and develops your ability to take your yoga practice off the mat into your day to day life.

I teach in English, German and Spanish
