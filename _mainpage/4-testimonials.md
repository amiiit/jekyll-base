  "I was fortunate enough to experience a few yoga classes with Anja. She was fantastic in acknowledging everyoneâ€™s varied levels of experience (I am a beginner) and she was patient when teaching us the basics. She has a calm and relaxing manner about her and I would certainly recommend Anja to anyone looking for a trustworthy yoga teacher."

"Anja came and taught us yoga at the studio weekly for almost 8 months. It was such a pleasure to have her as a teacher and we all looked forward to our weekly yoga lesson after work. Having the chance to breathe, move, stretch, and reflect together as coworkers and friends was a great way to end our day. Yoga with Anja helped us relax and also helped relieve work-related tension, both mental, from stress, and physical, from sitting at a desk all day. We would highly recommend her as a knowledgable, experienced, and kind yoga teacher."
